# Game Boy APU (`dmg`)

The Game Boy's sound, in the DMG's CPU: two pulses, the first with a frequency
sweep, a wave channel playing thirty-two 4-bit samples out of RAM, and a noise
generator, mixed to stereo through two volume controls. The method behind every
section is in [CONFORMANCE.md](../CONFORMANCE.md).

## Digital parity

Measured by [`conform`](../../packages/conform), the harness, against
[Gb_Snd_Emu 0.1.4](../../packages/conform/oracles/gb-snd-emu), blargg's Game Boy
APU from 2005, on all four voices, over a song through the driver and six
scripts in [`packages/conform/corpus/dmg`](../../packages/conform/corpus/dmg). The numbers
between the markers are written by the harness (`pnpm --filter chipvoice-conform
baseline:dmg`); the reading of them below is a person's. CI reruns the corpus and
fails if any voice's identical count falls below the committed baseline.

**What the numbers say.** Read the last column, not the first. On every voice
nearly every run of edges lines up with the oracle's under a shift of its own,
on step times and on values: the pulses' duty cycles and rates, every envelope
in both directions, the wave sequence at all three levels, the noise register's
pattern in both widths. The identical-cycle count is low because the oracle and
the chip disagree on *when a note starts*, systematically: Gb_Snd_Emu takes a
voice's first step the moment it is triggered and does not reload the timer,
where the hardware reloads it and steps a full period later; its frame clock
ticks at time zero rather than on the divider's bit; its duty patterns for 50
and 75 percent are rotated. Each of those shifts every note by a constant, and
every shifted note counts as different on every cycle. The remaining unmatched
edges are the oracle's missing features: no zombie envelope, a sweep that
applies its frequency a period late, a wave channel that plays its first sample
at once. The oracle's [README](../../packages/conform/oracles/gb-snd-emu/README.md)
lists them; none is a chipvoice deviation from Pan Docs or from blargg's ROMs,
which check the hardware to the cycle and pass. What this oracle confirms that
no ROM does: the short noise sequence's pattern, and the envelope's steps. A
stronger oracle is ticket P3-4.

## Test ROMs

blargg's `dmg_sound` suite, run on the harness's own SM83 with the chip on the
bus (`pnpm --filter chipvoice-conform roms:dmg`). Each ROM reports through
blargg's `$A000` protocol, a code and the text it printed.

<!-- roms:begin -->
Run by `conform`'s SM83 fixture on 2026-09-04: 12 of 12 pass.

The twelve cover: register read masks and power; the length counters, including
the extra clock on an NRx4 write and their survival through power off; the
trigger's effects on every voice; the sweep, its overflow check on the trigger
and its negate trap; the sync of length and sweep clocks to the divider; and the
wave channel's RAM while it plays: what a read returns, what a write lands on,
and the corruption a retrigger causes on the DMG.

## Formula tests

`packages/chipvoice/test/gb.mjs`, run on every push.

| Test | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Pulse rate `4194304 / (32 (2048 - f))`, at the envelope's volume | pass |
| Envelope steps one level per 64 Hz clock | pass |
| Wave channel steps a sample every `(2048 - f) * 2` cycles, RAM high nibble first, first fetch after the trigger | pass |
| NR32 level shifts | pass |
| Noise shifts every `divisor << shift` cycles; long sequence 32767, short 127 | pass |
| Length counters at 256 Hz; the extra clock on enable | pass |
| Sweep by `f >> shift` per period; overflow ends the voice, on the trigger too | pass |
| Power off clears registers, keeps lengths; NR52 and unused bits read back | pass |

## Analog stage

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Reference unit | none yet |
| Capture | none |
| Tolerance | |
| Maximum band error | unmeasured |
| Corners measured | none |
| Resampling | the output stage: each DAC's 0 to 15 centred on 7.5, summed per side under NR50 and NR51, a 28 Hz high-pass, one sample per period by stepping the T-cycle clock |

The DMG's DACs, its mixer and its headphone amplifier are unmeasured. The output
stage is a placeholder built to be replaced by a measurement: a linear DAC, a
sum, a high-pass. A real unit's line-out under a known script is what it needs.

## Driver coverage

`GbDriver` in `packages/chipvoice/src/chips/gb/driver.ts`, checked by
`test/gb-driver.mjs`. The song's lead goes to pulse 1, its chord to pulse 2,
its bass to the wave channel, its percussion to the noise.

| Voice | Exercised | Not exercised |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ch1, ch2 | all four duties; the envelope's starting volume, retriggered on every change; frequency changes without a trigger; silence at volume 0 with the DAC on | the sweep (written off), the hardware envelope's decay, the length counter, the DAC switched off |
| ch3 | wave RAM loaded while the channel is off, a triangle by default or the instrument's own 32 samples; the three levels; frequency changes without a trigger | the length counter, a write to RAM while playing, a retrigger while playing |
| ch4 | every one of the 2A03's sixteen rates mapped onto a divisor and shift; both widths; a decaying volume table fitted to the hardware envelope; rate changes mid-note | a rising envelope, the length counter, a retrigger mid-note |
| NR50, NR51 | written once at power-on: 7 both sides, every voice both sides | panning, the master volume |

## Known deviations

| What | Deliberate | Why | Affects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stereo routing and master volume are not in the digital trace | yes | The trace is what each DAC is given; NR50 and NR51 act after the DACs and are the output stage's | parity only; the output stage applies them |
| The wave channel's first fetch after a trigger is 6 cycles late | no, but unverified either way | blargg's notes give the delay; his ROMs 09, 10 and 12 pass with it and are sensitive to it to within two cycles | the first sample of every wave note |
| The wave RAM corruption on a retrigger is one model of a glitch that varies between units | yes | SameBoy's notes say most DMG-B units behave this way and some do not; blargg's ROM 10 checks this model | wave RAM after a retrigger while playing |
| The CGB's differences are not here | yes | The chip is the DMG's; a `cgb` chip would share the code with the differences switched | Game Boy Color behaviour |

## Power-on state

`reset()` puts the chip where the DMG is after the boot ROM has run except for
the chime: powered on, every register zero, the frame sequencer about to clock
its first step, the noise register all ones, wave RAM zero. The boot ROM's chime
leaves pulse 1's registers set and the master volume at 7 on both sides; the
harness's Game Boy writes those before a ROM runs.

## History

- 2026-09-04: the chip, from Pan Docs and blargg's notes; twelve of twelve
  dmg_sound ROMs after one fix, the wave corruption window moved to the two
  cycles before the fetch (`f636b9f`).

- Gb_Snd_Emu 0.1.4, as a second implementation of the plain behaviour.
